## Hi there 👋

<h1>Hi, I'm Tyrionna (Ty), an entry-level IT professional driven by curiosity, resilience, and a commitment to continous improvement. I'm pivoting into IT through hands on labs, networking, virtual machines, troubleshooting, and system fundamentals.  After developing 10+ years of transferable skills in customer service and administrative roles, I would like to merge those skills with my new found set of skills in IT. This GitHub documents my growth, technical skill development, and commitment to becoming a reliable and impactful IT professional.
